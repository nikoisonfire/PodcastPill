Things that we\u2019ve ignored or never considered before suddenly need look at. In depth.\nJoin me, Karen O\u2019Connor, and my guests each week as we chat about the things that are important to us: health, families, finances, our purpose in life, the community around us and the (state of!) world in general. We cover a bus load of topics that need to be discussed, from what men need to know about menopause to how to plan your own funeral, from style and looking good to how to lose the menopause fat.\nIf you\u2019ve asked the question or thought about something to do with life after 50, you\u2019ll hopefully find a podcast about it here. And if you don\u2019t, message me because it\u2019ll probably be a great topic to cover!\nSubscribe to the podcast so you don\u2019t miss a single thought provoking episode: https://www.mmmpodcast.me/email",

Hosted by noted author and commentator David Rothkopf and featuring regulars Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School, Kori Schake of Stanford University and David Sanger of the New York Times, the program will be the lively, smart dinner table conversation on the big issues of the day that you wish you were having...without the calories. Sometimes special guests will join the conversation and always the emphasis will be on providing the unvarnished perspectives others shy away from. Deep State Radio is the insider perspective on American national security and foreign policy that you can't find anywhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are enjoying this podcast, please consider becoming a member by visiting <a href=\"thedsrnetwork.com\">thedsrnetwork.com</a>.</p>",

    "description": "We have a different take on money than most financial experts. Kind of like if Chip and Joanna talked about money. You know, down-to-earth, approachable, easy to understand, and even fun. \nWe aren\u2019t going to judge you for your past mistakes and we haven\u2019t forgotten the pain of being broke so we can relate. We believe simple always beats complicated. And we believe money isn\u2019t the goal, but is simply a tool that can be used to fulfill what God has called us to do. \nSuccess with money. Success in Marriage. Success as a Christian. That\u2019s what we\u2019re after. If you want that too, then you\u2019ll love the show.\nOh and you don\u2019t have to live like a pauper, become an accountant, or work 100 hour weeks. We help you spend less time thinking about money while getting better results. \nThe SeedTime Money podcast is where we (Bob & Linda Lotich) share the mindsets, beliefs and strategies we used to go from being debt-ridden and broke to:\n- paying off $400k of debt\n- eliminating all guilt and shame with money\n- building multiple streams of passive income\n- honoring God with our finances\n- learning how to save & invest wisely\n- having financial unity in our marriage\n- giving $1 million by age 40\nOccasionally we interview guests like Mark Batterson, Annie F. Downs, Joshua Becker, Crystal Paine, Ruth Soukup, and other Biblically-minded Christian thought leaders as we seek to connect our faith with our personal finances.\nAfter subscribing, visit your favorite bookstore or library and grab our book \u2018*Simple Money, Rich Life*\u2019 where we share the 4-part Biblically-inspired formula we followed to completely turn our financial life around. \nAnd for daily encouragement and tips, stop by http://seedtime.com/ to get our newsletter, where we share all our best stuff.",

It started in March 2017 in the lead-up to major Italian wine events: OperaWine and Vinitaly, and has since become an award-winning show, recognized as one of the most frequently listened-to wine podcasts out there. Italy has more native grape varieties concentrated within its borders than any other country in the world, and Italian wine and grape diversity is a story worth telling. Meanwhile, the popularity of Italian wine continues to grow on an international scale, so, despite our name, our shows are equally geared towards the international wine community. The Italian Wine Podcast aims to inform, educate, and entertain fans through engaging conversations with producers, experts, and personalities of the Italian and international wine scene. #winepodcast #stories #wineeducation #drinksbusiness #italianwine bestpodcasts #new",

But focusing just on wealth misses the point. \n\nI believe what most of us actually want is to have choice.\n\nChoice in how much time we give to income-producing activities.\nChoice about what those income-producing activities are.\nChoice about where we live.\nChoice about when we retire.\nChoice about the ways we use our money to produce happiness.\n\nIn the Financial Autonomy podcast, I explore the different ways you can gain choice - from investing in stocks to becoming self-employed, starting a side hustle, or buying an investment property. I share learnings I've gained working with clients for over 20 years as a Certified Financial Planner, and interview others with interesting insights or experiences in gaining choice in life.",

    "description": "Earth Ancients chronicles the growing (and often suppressed) evidence of known and unknown civilizations, their ruined cities, and artifacts developed from advanced science and technology. Erased from the pages of time, these cultures discovered and charted the heavens, developed medicine and unleashed advancements that parallel and, in many cases, surpass our own. Join us and discover our lost history.<br />Armed with the thousands of anomalous archeological discoveries which have not been covered by conventional science and the media, we can no longer deny our ancient cultural inheritance. Our written history is wrong and we\u2019ve been led to believe that humanity is just a few hundred thousand years old. In fact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived onplanet Earth through a series of rebirths.It\u2019s now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.      <br />Though Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our<br /><br />planet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourseabout human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence.",

    "title": "Catch my Killer",
    "description": "At any given time in the world, there are thousands of unsolved murders. Most of them will never be solved.  The first 48 hours of a homicide are the most crucial to an investigation. Eventually, leads dry up, witnesses become less cooperative, and cases  go cold (unsolved). Meanwhile, detectives continue receiving new homicide cases which push older ones to the back. After a case goes cold, it quickly becomes yesterday\u2019s news. The public and the media will forget about the crime and move onto the next crime story. <br /><br />But do you know who won\u2019t forget about a cold case? The victim\u2019s family and friends. They won\u2019t forget because their case is more than a case file or news story. The victims were sons, fathers, mothers, daughters, or friends.  Catch my Killer is a podcast that focuses on the victim's surviving family and friends who give a voice to those who no longer have one. If you are listening and can help bring a killer to justice, please call in your tips. Even the smallest clue could be large enough to break a case wide open. <br /><br />Please be sure to visit my website for more information about my true crime and paranormal newspaper columns at <a href=\"http://www.themarcabe.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.themarcabe.com</a>. You can also help support my podcast by subscribing to my true crime Patreon page. You will receive an extra podcast episode per month (true crime, paranormal or a combination of both.)

    "description": "<p>Since 2015, Bryan Tobin has been hosting, editing, and producing Tobin Tonight where he interviews celebrities.\u00a0Tobin talks to musicians, comedians actresses, actors, and athletes.\u00a0Bryan was born and raised in Newfoundland. His passion is media, and he loves to conduct interviews and be a bit of a character in front of the camera. Secretly he'd like to\u00a0be a comedian but he loves hosting and interviewing.\u00a0Bryan's past work includes working with\u00a0CBC, CTV, and Ottawa Sun.\u00a0But don\u2019t expect a hard-hitting conversation in the interview, expect some laughs and a relaxing conversation. Treat it like a Tinder Date but both parties show up.\u00a0</p>",

Inspired by her lifestyle blog The Simply Luxurious Life, Shannon Ables (the original Simple Sophisticate) shares with listeners tips on how to live a refined life on an everyday income, a life of true contentment. Founded on the principle of the art of living a life of quality over quantity, episodes explore topics ranging from creating an everyday life you love living, strengthening mindfulness practices, preparing seasonally delicious meals, building a capsule wardrobe, traveling the world (Francophiles and Anglophiles tune in as Paris as well as the English countryside are favorite destinations), and living life to the fullest without breaking the bank because living well is really quite simple.\n\n*illustration by artist Sarah L\u00f6cker exclusively commissioned for the show",

    "description": "My name is Nick Viall and I host The Viall Files, a podcast that one anonymous reviewer called \u201csurprisingly insightful and substantive.\u201d\nThe Viall Files explores all things dating and love - from post-breakup healing to salacious texts - in our three (and sometimes four) weekly episodes. \nAsk Nick -  Every Monday, listeners navigating a challenging yet relatable interpersonal circumstance--from a 2 year situationship to a blowout fight with their mom to a friendship feud to reigniting intimacy after 10 years of marriage--call in for Nick's signature blunt yet compassionate advice. It's ripe with the type of hard truths your friends are too afraid to say, but you're better off for hearing.\nBachelor Recap - We break down this week's episode of the Bachelor, Bachelorette, or Bachelor in Paradise on Tuesdays. This color commentary is full of hot takes, debates, jokes, and the insider knowledge only a former Bachelor can provide. Nick, Ali and Amanda are joined by special celebrity guests--you'd be surprised how many of your favorite actors and comedians are closet bachelor fans.\nFreestyle - On Tuesday during the Bachelor \"off-season,\" we dive into the hot-button, zeitgeist topics--the latest celebrity drama, trending reality tv shows, new love song/music video that everyone's obsessed with, and occasionally a months-long highly publicized defamation trial between divorced A-list actors. Our lively discussions include takeaways we can all relate to. \nWe also have \"Texting Office Hours,\" a segment where we help a caller craft, edit, and press the send button on a nerve-wracking message. \nGoing Deeper - Every Thursday, a special guest joins the show for a tell-all interview and to discuss their latest project, their philosophies on love and relationships, plus the most relevant pop culture topics. These episodes conclude with our beloved \"Texting Office Hours \" segment where Nick, the guest, and our co-hosts team up to give advice to a listener on a message they need help writing.\nThe Update Show - The last Friday of the month, by popular demand (and we mean POPULAR) cliffhangers are resolved and burning questions are answered with updates from our most engaging callers. These much-anticipated follow-ups reveal if the caller took Nick's advice and how everything transpired, providing much-needed resolution to the callers' stories that stole our hearts and attention.",

    "title": "The Hollywood Godfather Podcast",
    "description": "Welcome to The Hollywood Godfather Podcast. Actor, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and Mafia associate Gianni Russo best known for portraying Carlo in \u2018The Godfather\u2019 has teamed with an unlikely ally, Patrick Picciarelli, writer, retired NYPD lieutenant, and current private investigator to put together a thought-provoking, tragic, funny, and often shocking view of Gianni\u2019s life in the mob and the movies. His counterpart and co-host, Patrick, gives his insights into the world of crime, and comments on characters both men have known, as well as the current happenings in Hollywood and the mob.\nThe friendship between Gianni and Patrick did not have the usual beginnings of boyhood camaraderie. Both Gianni and Patrick were born and raised in New York\u2019s Little Italy and lived a scant short block from each other, but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Gianni sought his future with the Mafia, while Patrick became a New York cop. Their paths crossed a few times, and each was on the other\u2019s radar; distrust and wariness always hovering. However, they became friends and now discuss all the complexities that surround the two diverse worlds of organized crime and police work. \nAdded to the dynamic is Megan Horan, a college graduate with a degree in film & television who grew up in suburban Philadelphia and now resides in New York City. A young, intelligent female voice looking to break into the entertainment industry, Megan was chosen personally by Gianni Russo to represent the millennial age group - one that may lack the knowledge of the generation regarding Old Hollywood and the Italian Mafia, yet possesses the interest in the topics.\nGianni, Patrick, and Megan's weekly podcast delves into the world of the Mafia, crime, international intrigue, inside Hollywood, and places such as the Vatican and Iraq; that one would never think of in the same sentence as the mob and cops. Fascinating stories include Hollywood stars such as Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and Marlon Brando along with numerous prominent Mafia figures and even U.S. Presidents. The group is frequently joined by special celebrity guests, such as Paul Anka, Steve Schirripa, Chazz Palminteri, George Gallo, Nick Vallelonga, Tom Dreesen, Patrick Bet-David, and more. They also answer email questions and frequently interact with listeners on-air.\nThe Hollywood Godfather Podcast releases a new show every Wednesday! Be sure to follow us on Instagram @hollywoodgodfather and on Facebook. \nThe book, \u201cHollywood Godfather: My Life in the Movies and the Mob\u201d by Gianni Russo with Patrick Picciarelli, was published in hardcover and audio by St. Martin\u2019s Press on March 12, 2019 and is available for purchase on Amazon.",

    "description": "<p>Dan Harris is a fidgety, skeptical journalist who had a panic attack\u00a0on live national television, which led him to try something he otherwise never would have considered: meditation. He went on to write the bestselling book,\u00a0<em>10% Happier</em>. On this show, Dan talks with eminent meditation teachers, top scientists, and even the odd celebrity. Guests include everyone from His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Bren\u00e9 Brown to Karamo from\u00a0<em>Queer Eye</em>. On some episodes, Dan ventures into the deep end of the pool, covering subjects such as enlightenment and psychedelics. On other episodes, it\u2019s science-based techniques for issues such as anxiety, productivity, and relationships. Dan's approach is seemingly modest, but secretly radical: happiness is a skill you can train, just like working your bicep in the gym. Your progress may be incremental at first, but like any good investment, it compounds over time.</p><p>New episodes come out every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for free.

    "description": "The Unreserved Wine Talk podcast features candid conversations with the most fascinating people in the wine world. Your host, award-winning journalist Natalie MacLean, dives into how it feels to compete in the nerve-wracking World's Best Sommelier Competition, the shadowy underground of wine forgery, the zany tactics of a winemaker who hosted a funeral for cork, and more. Nestled in these colourful stories are practical tips on how to choose wine from a restaurant list, pair it with food and spot great values in the liquor store.\n\nEvery second episode, Natalie goes solo with an unfiltered, personal reflection on wine. She'll share with you how it feels to be a woman in what is still a largely male-dominated field, her gut reaction to the latest health study that says no amount of alcohol consumption is safe and her journey in writing her next book. She'll reveal these vulnerable, sometimes embarrassing, stories with tipsy wit and wisdom that she's soaked up from 20 years of writing about wine.\n\nThis podcast is for wine lovers from novices to well-cellared aficionados.",

    "description": "Hi! We\u2019re Emma and Fin! We\u2019re a married couple in our thirties who have been exploring non-monogamy for over 15 years. Every week we interview people from across the spectrums of gender, sexuality, and relationship styles to hear their amazing stories. \nMany of our guests identify as swingers or polyamorous. However, quite a few have redefined non-monogamy in their own way by creating a unique dynamic that works for them. We hope that by giving a voice to the diverse community exploring non-monogamy that we can show people they are not alone and inspire them to embrace their true selves so that, together, we can open minds and live authentically without shame.\nWe hope you enjoy the show and who knows, maybe someday you\u2019ll even be up for sharing your own story. We\u2019d love to hear it!",

    "description": "<p>It's me, your friend Busy Philipps! My creative partner Caissie St. Onge & I love making things that we believe people need & will love & we\u2019ve had so many plans. We had plans to do a TV show that would shake up late night! And we think it kinda did! For six months. We adored our genius, scrappy creative team at \u201cBusy Tonight\u201d as much as we loved our audience, so when we broke the news that we\u2019d been canceled, we vowed to get back up & make even bigger plans to invent a whole new way of doing things in the entertainment biz, to reunite our beautiful staff & change the game for everyone! An entertainment Utopia! And we were so close, then...the world changed. Now those plans are, at the very least, on hold. So, we've shifted gears, like everyone has had to, & with our friends, we're just doing our best, taking it slow & talking to fascinating friends about how *they* are doing *their* best. They\u2019ll tell us all about those times in their lives when a setback actually led to the right thing. Maybe it was a job that didn't pan out, but opened the door to an even more perfect one, or maybe it's how they studied for years to do the thing they thought was their calling, only to fall into something else that felt like kismet. The thing is, we want to share those moments because right now EVERYBODY is having one of those moments. Maybe we'll all learn something life-changing or maybe we'll just have a conversation where we break down in tears, then laugh at ourselves for crying. Whatever happens, we can assure you, Busy Philipps is Doing Her Best!</p>",
